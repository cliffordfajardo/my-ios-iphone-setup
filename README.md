## Philosphy
I view my phone as a tool and not so much as an entertainment device. I intentionally consume my entertainment on my desktop or laptop only.

## How I Organize My Phone

#### My Applications
These are the apps I've downloaded off the app store that I most frequently use.
I have few apps like Zoom, my bank app, airbnb, lyft venmo that I use once a month, but I decided not to list those 1 off apps which I have very few of.

- Google Apps
  - Google Drive
  - Google Calendar
  - Google Maps
  - Google Photos - *I use this to backup all my photos as I taken them*
  - Google Fi - *I manage my phone service with Google here*
- 1Password - *a password manager for forgetful people like me.*
- Adblock X - *adblocker for Safari. Mostly use it to speed up web pages by blocking ads from loading.*
- DayOne - *the app I use for journaling almost everyday.* I've used it for nearly 5 years. It has an export to PDF option which is nice
- Nofeed - block out newsfeeds from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram. It's a safeguard so I don't waste time. If I do really need to see a newsfeed I turn if off.
- Mixcam - dual camera for my iPhone
- Messenger - *I use this over facebook.com for checking my messages to avoid distractions*
- Spotify - *my music service*
- My Fitness Pal - *Food tracker that allows me to simply scan the label on the food you eat and that's it!*
- Multitimer app - I create timers with this app.
- Liberate - *a distraction blocker.*
- Notion - *similar to Google Drive, but much more flexible, customizable and amazing!*
- Slack - *keep up to date with my close friends*
- Yelp - *food reviews when I'm on the go*

#### My Social Media Apps
I don't keep social media apps on my phone. I only download them when I'm traveling or going to a social event.
If prefer to check my social media on my desktop computer, but if I need to check it on mobile, I'll just use the web version.

Why not just keep the app on your phone?
- I use social media intentionally and don't like to stay on there too long.
  - Ever wasted time scrolling down your newsfeed?
- Removing the app from my phone means it requires me to take extra steps before using the app and think why I want to use it.

#### Settings
- Grayscale: I use my iPhone 99% of the time on Grayscale mode. This great at reducing distractions since colors don't stand out.
- Safari
  - Absolutely blank tabs. This is to avoid unconscious browsing. I don't want my phone suggesting searches or triggering thoughts. To achieve this the following were turned off in safar settings:
    - no bookmarks (all were deleted)
    - no favorites (all were deleted)
    - siri suggestions turned off
- Notifications for all apps are off except:
  - Calendar
  - Messages
- Display Settings
  - I have Night Shift enabled from 6pm - 7am. This reduces the white light emmited the iPhone screen. At night white light from our phones has the effect of often killing our urge to sleep.
